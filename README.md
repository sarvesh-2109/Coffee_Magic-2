## **Features**

- This coffee machine allows users to choose from a variety of drinks available on the menu.
- Users can select drinks, check resources, and make payments.
- The Coffee Maker class ensures the availability of resources and prepares the selected drink.
- The Money Machine class handles payments and returns change.

## **Object-Oriented Design**

The project follows an object-oriented approach, where the functionality is divided into separate classes with specific responsibilities:

- **Menu:** Handles the menu of available drinks.
- **CoffeeMaker:** Manages the resources required to make drinks.
- **MoneyMachine:** Manages payments and change.

## **How to Use**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `main.py` script to start the Coffee Machine simulation.
3. Follow the prompts to choose drinks, check resources, and make payments.

## **Contributions**
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues or want to add new features, feel free to create a pull request.

## **Credits**
This project is inspired by the Coffee Machine project from the "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" course on Udemy.
